Rendering a scene with global illumination can be a time consuming task especially when we have complex objects and multiple light sources in the scene. Reducing this render time is our motivation behind applying deep learning methods for adding shadows to a scene. Given a rendered image of the scene without shadows, and a certain representation of the type and location of the light source, we aim to apply the image to image transformation paradigm to generate an image with shadows added. This problem entails prediction of occlusion of objects in the scene and also understanding the structure and orientation of the objects.
